✨ **Welcome to my zone**

This is where I:

- 🚩 solve LeetCode problems while blasting Charli XCX
- 🧃 drink es kopi and forget semicolons
- 🩷 cry over edge cases
- 🛠️ push questionable solutions
- 🧑‍💻 *crash the stack, but make it aesthetic*

## What’s here?

🪐 **LeetCode practice files**, mostly in Python and C++, structured per problem.

🛸 **Funky commit messages** so I don’t get bored.

🌸 **Vroom-vroom energy** for solving DSA one bug at a time.

## Goals
✅ Practice consistently (ish)  
✅ Improve pattern recognition  
✅ Not cry (too much)  
✅ AC > WA
